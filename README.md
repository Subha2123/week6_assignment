#FIND MOSTUSED WORDS

Find the most common words
   Counting word occurrence
    In this assignment,i should  start with a  string that contains a number of words. 
    Then, define the number of times each word appears in the given text. After that point, find  what the top three words used are.
   
   The given words will need to be scrubbed of any punctuation. To do so, I might choose to use regex and "replace".
   The JavaScript compiler does not think a lowercase and an uppercase letter are the same letter the way humans do. To avoid this, set the entire string to be in lowercase.
   for this purpose i should used toLowerCase()function.
   
   then i have used sort function to order the array in ascending order.
   After that i have used slice()function to find most used three words in an array
